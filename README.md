=============
This code has made as a excitement to do same project of 'MORSE CODE INTERPRETER' in different coding language.

**Please feel free to use the Issues feature of GitHub if you run into problems or have suggestions for important features to implement. This is the best way to get in touch.**

Thanks For Your Support!
------------------------



Requirements and Setup
----------------------
For running this code you need - 

1] Python 3

2] Following Libraries


Library Installation
---------------------
For Running this code on your computer you need to install python libraries as following -

1] pynput

2] colorama

3] windsound



Further Details
---------------
In this code we have set four different modes. Each mode having different functions & the fuctions of each mode we have given below.


Code Modes
--------------
### Trainer Mode
In this mode we have free to do anything. Also, in this mode only three keyboard buttons are functional.

1] Space Bar

2] Esc

3] Down Arrow

Function of these buttons you will understand while running code

### Character To Morse Mode
In this mode we have to enter a character or word or sentence. Then this will be converted into the morse code.

### Morse To Character Mode
In this mode we have to enter the morse code. Then this will be converted into the characters.

### Tester Mode
In this mode five tests are given. We have to solve these to know our knowledge about morse code. After solving test score is shown. Also, in this mode only three keyboard buttons are functional.

1] Space Bar

2] Esc

3] Right Arrow

Function of these buttons you will understand while running code



Valid Characters
----------------
The standard uppercase and lowercase letters 'A' through 'Z' and digits '0' through '9' are of course supported, along with a handful of punctuation and special characters. The following table indicates the special characters supported along with the corresponding Morse code. Other input characters are ignored.

Also we have provided the morse code image.
